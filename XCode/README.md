# XCode

Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the App store or the Apple developer website. 

For installing Xcode command line tools run the command 

        xcode-select --install

It'll prompt you to install the command line tools. Follow the instructions and now you have Xcode and Xcode command line tools both installed and running.
