# Docker

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com) is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, ship, and run applications. Docker lets you quickly assemble applications from components and eliminates the friction that can come when shipping code. Docker lets you get your code tested and deployed into production as fast as possible.

With Docker, developers can build any app in any language using any toolchain. “Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere - colleagues’ macOS and Windows laptops, QA servers running Ubuntu in the cloud, and production data center VMs running Red Hat.

## Docker for Mac

Docker for Mac is the current release of Docker for macOS.

### Installation

### Prerequisite

You'll need `homebrew-cask` to install Docker Toolbox, if you don't have it refer to [this section](../Homebrew/Cask.md).

### Installation
