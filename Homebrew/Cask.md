# Homebrew Cask

Let's see if we can get the elegance, simplicity, and speed of Homebrew for the installation and management of GUI Mac applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

### Install

Install Homebrew-cask is really straight forward. We just need to add the cask tap and then install brew cask.

    $ brew install caskroom/cask/brew-cask
    $ brew cask install google-chrome

### Search

It is really simple to check if the app is supported by cask by going to the search page on [caskroom.io](http://caskroom.io/)

### Quick look plugins

Some [plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins) to enable different files to work with Mac Quicklook. Includes features like syntax highlighting, markdown rendering, preview of jsons, patch files, csv, zip files etc.

    $ brew cask install qlcolorcode
    $ brew cask install qlstephen
    $ brew cask install qlmarkdown
    $ brew cask install quicklook-json
