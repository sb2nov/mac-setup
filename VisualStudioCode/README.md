### Python Extension

Install this extension for Python code highlighting

Configure the two things below, in order to enable auto-formatting on "Save", i.e. `âŒ˜ + S`

1. Change the default formatter to "`Black`" instead of "`Autopep8`". Very critical to avoid large diffs. Go to "Preferences" -> User Settings and update the setting "`python.formatter.provider`" to "Black" https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/editing

2. Enable `Format on Save` Setting: "Editor: Format On Save" setting on Code -> Preferences -> Settings

3. To test, Open a Python file and check if you write code that it automatically formats on saving the file.
