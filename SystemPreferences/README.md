# System Preferences

## First Time Setup

The first thing you should do is update your system. To do that go:
**Apple menu (ï£¿) > About This Mac > Software Update.**

Also upgrade your OS to the latest version to have a more secure OS. macOS
upgrades are usually free so you might as well keep your machine up to date.

If this is a new computer there are a couple tweaks you could make to the
System Preferences. **These settings are all optional, consider them
suggestions. Always choose the setting that makes the most sense to you.**

## Users & Groups

- _Login Options_ -> _Change fast user switching menu as Icon_
- Set up _Password_, _Apple ID_, _Picture_, etc.

## Trackpad

- _Point & Click_
    - Enable _Tap to click with one finger_
    - Change _Secondary click_ to _Right corner_
    - Uncheck _Three Finger Drag_

    - Uncheck _all_ apart from _Zoom in and out_

## Dock

killall Dock # Restart the Dock process
```

## Finder

    - Change _New finder window show_ to open in your _Home Directory_

  [_Alfred_](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

## Accounts

- Add an _iCloud account_ and sync _Calendar_, _Find my Mac_, _Contacts_ etc.

## User Defaults

- Enable _repeating keys by pressing and holding down keys_: `defaults write
  NSGlobalDomain ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false` (and restart any app
  that you need to repeat keys in)
- Change the _default folder for screenshots_
    - Open the terminal and create the folder where you would like to store
      your screenshots: `mkdir -p /path/to/screenshots/`
    - Then run the following command: `defaults write com.apple.screencapture
      location /path/to/screenshots/ && killall SystemUIServer`
