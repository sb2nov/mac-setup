# System Preferences

## First Time Setup

The first thing you should do is update your system. To do that go:
**Apple menu (ï£¿) > About This Mac > Software Update.**

Also upgrade your OS to the latest version to have a more secure OS. macOS
upgrades are usually free so you might as well keep your machine up to date.

If this is a new computer there are a couple tweaks you could make to the
System Preferences. **These settings are all optional, consider them
suggestions. Always choose the setting that makes the most sense to you.**
