   Hi,
   Thanks for taking the time to contribute to making this guide even better!
   While we do appreciate bug reports, we would love to see a PR fixing the issue even more.
   This guide is intended to be built by the community and not only the maintainers :)
   We (the maintainers) don't know everything, but if we all work together we can make this
   guide the best available. Thank you <3
