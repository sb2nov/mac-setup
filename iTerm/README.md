## iTerm2

Since we're going to be spending a lot of time in the command-line, let's install a better terminal than the default one. Download and install [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/).

In **Finder**, drag and drop the **iTerm** Application file into the **Applications** folder.

You can now launch iTerm, through the **Launchpad** for instance.

Let's just quickly change some preferences.

### Colors and Font Settings
- Set hotkey to open and close the terminal to `command + option + i`
- Go to profiles -> Default -> Check silence bell
- Download the [Solarized dark iterm colors](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized) from here. And then set these to your default profile colors.
- Change the cursor text and cursor color to yellow make it more visible
- Change the font to 14pt Source Code Pro Lite. Source Code Pro can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/adobe/source-code-pro/downloads).

Add `export CLICOLOR=1` line to your `~/.bash_profile` file for nice coloring of listings.
