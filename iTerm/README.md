## iTerm2

Since we're going to be spending a lot of time in the command-line, let's install a better terminal than the default one. Download and install [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com/).

In **Finder**, drag and drop the **iTerm** Application file into the **Applications** folder.

You can now launch iTerm, through the **Launchpad** for instance.

Let's just quickly change some preferences.

### Colors and Font Settings

* Set hotkey to open and close the terminal to `command + option + i`
* Go to profiles -&gt; Default -&gt; Terminal -&gt; Check silence bell
* Download [one of iTerm2 color schemes](http://iterm2colorschemes.com). And then set these to your default profile colors. 
  * I prefer Spring & Spacegray Eighties
* Change the cursor text and cursor color to yellow make it more visible
* Change the font to 13pt Inconsolata, can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/raw/master/Inconsolata/Inconsolata for Powerline.otf).
