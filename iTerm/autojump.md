# `autojump`

`autojump` is a faster way to navigate your filesystem. It works by maintaining a database of the directories you use the most from the command line.

## Installation

To install the latest version, use homebrew:

```bash
$ brew install autojump
```

## Usage

Navigate to your most-visited directories as usual using `cd`, for example if you had a directory called `work/github/mac-setup`

```bash
cd work/github/mac-setup
```

The next time you want to navigate to the same directory, use autojump like so -

```bash
j mac-setup
```
