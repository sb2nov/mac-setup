# Python

macOS, like Linux, ships with [Python](https://python.org/) already installed.
But you don't want to mess with the system Python (some system tools rely on
it, etc.), so we'll install our own version(s). There are two ways to install
Python, (1) Homebrew and (2) Pyenv. If you plan to use multiple versions of
Python (e.g. 2, 3, and anaconda) then you should use pyenv.

## Installation

### Homebrew method

Python 3 is the default version when installing with Homebrew, so if you want
to install Python 2.7 you'll have to be explicit about it.

**Python 3**

    $ brew install python

**Python 2.7**

    $ brew install python@2

Installing Python also installs [pip](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/)
(and its dependency [Setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools)),
which is the package manager for Python. Let's upgrade them both:

    $ pip install --upgrade setuptools
    $ pip install --upgrade pip

Executable scripts from Python packages you install will be put in
`/usr/local/share/python`, make sure it's on your `PATH`.

### Pyenv method

[`pyenv`](https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv) is a Python version manager that can
manage and install different versions of Python. Works very much like `rbenv`
for Ruby. First, we must install `pyenv` using Homebrew:

    $ brew install pyenv

To upgrade `pyenv` in the future, use `upgrade` instead of `install`. After
installing, add `pyenv init` to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion
(use `.zshrc` if you're using `zsh`).

    $ echo 'eval "$(pyenv init -)"' >> ~/.bash_profile

Restart your shell so the path changes take effect.

    $ exec $SHELL

You can now begin using `pyenv`. To list the all available versions of Python,
including Anaconda, Jython, PyPy and Stackless, use:

    $ pyenv install --list

Then install the desired versions:

    $ pyenv install 2.7.12
    $ pyenv install 3.5.2

Use the `global` command to set global version(s) of Python to be used in all
shells. For example, if you prefer 2.7.12 over 3.5.2:

    $ pyenv global 2.7.12 3.5.2
    $ pyenv rehash

The leading version takes priority. All installed Python versions can be
located in `~/.pyenv/versions`. Alternatively, you can run:

    $ pyenv versions
      system (set by /Users/your_account/.pyenv/version)
    * 2.7.12
    * 3.5.2

This shows an asterisk `*` next to the currently active version.

### Application-specific Python version

The `local` command will set local application-specific Python version(s) by
writing the version name to a `.python-version` file in the current directory.
This version overrides the global version. For example, to install
anaconda3-4.1.1 in `path/to/directory`:

    $ pyenv install anaconda3-4.1.1
    $ cd path/to/directory
    $ pyenv local anaconda3-4.1.1
    $ pyenv rehash
    $ pyenv versions
      system
      2.7.12
      3.5.2
    * anaconda3-4.1.1 (set by /Users/your_account/path/to/directory/.python-version)
