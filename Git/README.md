# Git

What's a developer without [Git](http://git-scm.com/)? To install, simply run:

    $ brew install git

When done, to test that it installed fine you can run:

    $ git --version

And `$ which git` should output `/usr/local/bin/git`.

Next, we'll define your Git user (should be the same name and email you use for [GitHub](https://github.com/)):

    $ git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
    $ git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

They will get added to your `.gitconfig` file.

To push code to your GitHub repositories, we're going to use the recommended HTTPS method (versus SSH). So you don't have to type your username and password everytime, let's enable Git password caching as described [here](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git):

    $ git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain

**Note**: On a Mac, it is important to remember to add `.DS_Store` (a hidden OS X system file that's put in folders) to your `.gitignore` files.
