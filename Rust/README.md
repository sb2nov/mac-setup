# Rust
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety.

## Installation
For installation it's advised to use `rustup` as it will (among other things)
allow you to switch between versions of Rust without having to download
anything additional.

```sh
$ brew install rustup
```

Use rustup to install the Rust compiler (rustc) and the Rust package manager (cargo).

```sh
$ rustup-init
```

To verify you can run:

```sh
$ rustc --version
```
