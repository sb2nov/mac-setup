# Emacs

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor.

Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s, and work on its direct descendant, GNU Emacs, continues actively as of 2017.

## Installation

There are many Emacs clients on macOS. The recommended version on macOS is Emacs Mac Port, but others are good as well.

### [Emacs Mac port](https://bitbucket.org/mituharu/emacs-mac/overview) (Recommended)

Many useful features are built with Emacs Mac Port, e.g. environment variables, full screen, visual enhancements and so on.

Link the Homebrew tap first.

```shell
brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport
```

* Method 1: Install with `brew cask`.

  ```shell
  brew cask install emacs-mac
  ```

  There are three available versions, `emacs-mac`, `emacs-mac-official-icon`, `emacs-mac-spacemacs-icon`.

* Method 2: Build from source with Homebrew.

  ```shell
  brew install emacs-mac [options]
  brew linkapps emacs-mac
  ```

> **Note**: You might want to install [exec-path-from-shell](https://github.com/purcell/exec-path-from-shell) if you are using Emacs plus. It takes care of your environment variables.

> **Note**: to have the title bar match your theme background color, consider using instead:
> `brew install emacs-plus --HEAD --with-natural-title-bars`

## Spacemacs

[Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/README.md) is a new way to experience Emacs -- a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

Spacemacs can be used naturally by both Emacs and Vim users -- you can even mix the two editing styles. Switching easily between input styles makes Spacemacs a great tool for pair-programming.

### Installation

1. If you have an existing Emacs configuration, back it up first:

   ```sh
   cd ~
   mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak
   mv .emacs .emacs.bak
   ```

   Don't forget to backup and _remove_ `~/.emacs` file otherwise Spacemacs
   **WILL NOT** load since that file prevents Emacs from loading the proper
   initialization file.

2. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
   ```

   `master` is the stable branch and it is _immutable_, **DO NOT** make any
   modification to it or you will break the update mechanism. If you want to
   fork Spacemacs safely use the `develop` branch where you handle the update
   manually.

3. (Optional) Install the [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro) font.

   If you are running in terminal you'll also need to change font settings of
   your terminal.

4. Launch Emacs. Spacemacs will automatically install the packages it requires.
   If you get an error regarding package downloads then you may try to disable
   the HTTPS protocol by starting Emacs with

   ```sh
   emacs --insecure
   ```

   Or you can set the `dotspacemacs-elpa-https` to `nil` in your dotfile to
   remove the need to start Emacs with `--insecure` argument. You may wish to
   clear out your `.emacs.d/elpa` directory before doing this, so that any
   corrupted packages you may have downloaded will be re-installed.

5. Restart Emacs to complete the installation.

## Purcell's Emacs configuration

This is [Purcell's](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) emacs configuration tree, continually used and tweaked since 2000, and it may be a good starting point for other Emacs users, especially those who are web developers. These days it's somewhat geared towards macOS, but it is known to also work on Linux and Windows.

### Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the `init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly running `M-x package-refresh-contents` before doing so.

## Doom Emacs

[Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) is a configuration for GNU Emacs written by a stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic ex-vimmer. It wasn't originally intended for public use, but can be considered a hacker's starter kit.

### Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
cp init.example.el init.el  # maybe edit init.el
make install
```

Don't forget to run `make` every time you modify `init.el`!
