*This book is a fork of a book by [Sourabh](http://sourabhbajaj.com). It helped me a lot of understanding setting up my mac while I was learning python. I adapted it a bit to my needs and republished it.*

[Mac OS X Setup Guide](https://jceelen.gitbooks.io/mac-setup)
====================

This book covers the basics of setting up a development environment on a new MacBook for most major languages. All instructions covered have been tested on Mountain Lion and Mavericks, but they might be more inclined towards Mavericks. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this book is intended for everyone to use as a reference when installing some languages/libraries.

We will set up [Node](http://nodejs.org) (JavaScript), [Python](http://www.python.org), [CPlusPlus](http://www.cplusplus.com), and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) environments. Even if you don't program in all four, it is good to have them, as many command-line tools use one of them. We also install a few daily use applications and Latex. As you read and follow these steps, feel free to send me any feedback or comments you may have.

All contributions to the book are welcome. Please help add support for other libraries and languages.

**Looking for contributors to maintain and extend the documentation more**
