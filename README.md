# [Symph Development Environment](http://sym.ph)

====================

This book is actually a fork from the original guide by [Sourabh Bajaj](http://sourabhbajaj.com/) (_A million thanks to him!_) and is modifed heavily to fit the needs of a modern day Symph developer.

Got a new mac? New to the team Symph? No worries! This guide covers the basics of setting up a development environment on Mac OSX (El Capitan). 

Most of our developers here speak parseltongue, So we're gonna set up [Python](http://www.python.org), & [GoogleApp Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/).

We will also set up some basic stuff like [Node](http://nodejs.org) (JavaScript), [Git](https://git-scm.com) and your tips to making your terminal look badass. We also install a few daily use applications. 

All contributions to the book are welcome. 

\*Note: We're looking for contributors to maintain and extend the documentation even more!
