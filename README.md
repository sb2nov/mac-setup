This guide covers the basics of setting up a development environment on a new
Mac. Whether you are an experienced programmer or not, this guide is intended
for everyone to use as a reference for setting up your environment or
installing languages/libraries.

Some of the environments we will set up are [Node](https://nodejs.org)
(JavaScript), [Python](https://www.python.org),
[C++](http://www.cplusplus.com) and [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org).
Even if you don't program in all of them, they are useful to have as many
command-line tools rely on them. We'll also show you some useful daily use
applications. As you read and follow these steps, feel free to post any
feedback or comments you may have.
