Some of the environments we will set up are [Node](http://nodejs.org) (JavaScript), [Python](http://www.python.org), [CPlusPlus](http://www.cplusplus.com) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org). Even if you don't program in all of them, they are useful to have as many command-line tools rely on them. We'll also show you some useful daily use applications. As you read and follow these steps, feel free to post any feedback or comments you may have.

All contributions to the guide are welcome. Please help add support for other libraries and languages. To make a contribution please use our [contribution template](.github/CONTRIBUTION_TEMPLATE.md).
