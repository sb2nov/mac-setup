# LaTeX
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/about/), which is pronounced «Lah-tech» or «Lay-tech», is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing.

## Installation
When installing LaTex, two following options are given to users.
  1. Install MacTeX with builtin editor (TexLive) - (2GB)
  2. Install BasicTeX only (100MB) + your personal LaTeX editor

### MacTeX vs BasicTeX
MacTeX includes additional programs such as an editor and a BibTeX reference manager that help users to work with TeX outside of the command line. BasicTeX does not include these GUI programs. The trade-off that comes with using BasicTeX is that you will have to download and install additional packages and programs as the need arises- and BasicTeX is so basic that the need will arise. So, after installing BasicTeX you will be faced with the tasks of installing additional programs and installing missing packages.

### Option 1
Download [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/).
For more details about MacTex [click here](https://www.tug.org/mactex/What_Is_Installed.pdf).

Since MaxTex installs an LaTex editor ([TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html)) already, installing another LaTeX editor is unnecessary.

### Option 2
Download [BasicTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html).
For more details about BasicTex [click Here](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/BasicTeX.pdf).

Now you should pick a LaTeX editor, here are some to choose from:
  1. [TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
  2. [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/)
  3. [TeXworks](https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/releases)
  4. [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/)
  5. [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/)
  6. [TeXlipse](http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/)
  7. [Sublime Text 3 - LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools)
