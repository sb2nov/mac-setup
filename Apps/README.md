# Apps

Here is a list of apps that are generally good to use and can come in handy in day to day tasks. The apps are separated into 4 broad categories _Developer Tools_, _Productivity Tools_, _Office Apps_ and _Other_.

## Development Tools

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/): Chrome is a developer friendly browser with powerful development tools built in to it.
- [Valentina Studio](http://www.valentina-db.com/en/valentina-studio-overview): Valentina Studio is a GUI to create, administer and query MySQL, Postgres and SQLite databases.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/): An open source editor built and maintained by GitHub, is very similar to Sublime Text in most aspects.

## Diff and Merge Tools

[FileMerge](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/): A free tool which is already installed on your machine. It might not be the most elegant tool, but it's definitely a solid one that does the job of comparing & merging text.

[Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/): Another tool for reviewing and merging text, images and folders. Its beautiful user interface and great image diffing capabilities are what sets it apart from other tools. Available for a trial period of 15 days and then it requires payment.

[Araxis Merge](http://www.araxis.com/merge/): One of the few diff tools that works with more than just text and image files, this one lets you also compare office documents (like MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, or ODF). A single license is valid for both Windows and Mac.

[DeltaWalker](http://www.deltawalker.com/): Just like Araxis, this app also lets you compare office files. However, it goes one step further by letting you compare file archives like ZIP, JAR, and TAR files. It also has great performance for comparing folders.

### Free alternatives

- [P4Merge](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools)
- [DiffMerge](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/)
Both of these tools can't compare in terms of features and user interface with their commercial competitors - but make for a valid alternative on Mac, Windows and Linux.
