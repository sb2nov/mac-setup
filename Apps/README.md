# Apps

Here is a list of apps that are generally good to use and can come in handy in day to day tasks. The apps are separated into 4 broad categories _Developer Tools_, _Productivity Tools_, _Office Apps_ and _Other_.

## Development Tools

## Diff and Merge Tools

[FileMerge](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/): A free tool which is already installed on your machine. It might not be the most elegant tool, but it's definitely a solid one that does the job of comparing & merging text.

[Araxis Merge](http://www.araxis.com/merge/): One of the few diff tools that works with more than just text and image files, this one lets you also compare office documents (like MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or ODF). A single license is valid for both Windows and Mac.

[DeltaWalker](https://www.deltawalker.com/): Just like Araxis, this app also lets you compare office files. However, it goes one step further by letting you compare file archives like ZIP, JAR, and TAR files. It also has great performance for comparing folders.
