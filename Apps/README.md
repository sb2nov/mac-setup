# Apps

Here is a quick list of apps that are generally good to use and can come in handy in day to day tasks. The apps are seperated into 4 broad categories Developer Tools, Productivity Tools, Office Apps and Others.

### Developer Tools
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/): Installs Chrome which is one of the best browsers currently. All chrome browsers and extensions are saved by Google so can be synced easily.
- [Valentina Studio](http://www.valentina-db.com/en/valentina-studio-overview):  Valentina Studio is a gui to create, administer and query MySQL, Postgres and SQLite databases.
- [Atom](https://atom.io/): Open source editor by Github and is very similar to Sublime Text in most aspects.

### Diff and Merge Tools

[FileMerge](): Being part of its developer toolset, Apple's own merge tool comes at no additional costs. It might not be the most elegant tool, but it's definitely a solid one that does the job of comparing & merging text.

[Kaleidoscope](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/): Originally developed by "Sofa", Kaleidoscope was later acquired by "BlackPixel" - who did a great job in making it one of the best diff & merge tools for the Mac. Its beautiful user interface and great image diffing capabilities are what set it apart.

[Beyond Compare](http://www.scootersoftware.com/): Originally a product for Microsoft Windows, the Beyond Compare team has contributed a fine diff tool to the Mac platform. Like Araxis Merge and DeltaWalker, it goes beyond (pun intended) comparing simple text and also allows diffing Word and PDF contents. In its "Pro Version", it also supports merging.

[Araxis Merge](http://www.araxis.com/merge/): One of the few diff tools that works with more than just text and image files, Araxis Merge lets you also compare office documents (like MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint, or ODF). For people working on both Windows and Mac, it's great to know that a single license is valid for both platforms.

[DeltaWalker](http://www.deltawalker.com/): Just like Araxis, the DeltaWalker app also lets you compare office files. However, it goes one step further by letting you compare file archives like ZIP, JAR, and TAR files. Also, if you're regularly performing comparisons on a folder basis, DeltaWalker shines with a great performance in this area.

**Free Alternatives**:
In case you're looking for a free alternative to the standard FileMerge app, you should also have a look at **[P4Merge](http://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools)** and **[DiffMerge](http://www.sourcegear.com/diffmerge/)**.
Both can't compare in terms of features and user interface with their commercial competitors - but make for a valid alternative on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
