## Install Package Control

The simplest method of installation is through the Sublime Text console. The console is accessed via `View > Show Console` menu. Once open, paste the appropriate Python code for your version of Sublime Text into the console.

This snippet changes each version and older versions will return an error.

To get the current versions code, go to [packagecontrol.io](https://packagecontrol.io/installation)
