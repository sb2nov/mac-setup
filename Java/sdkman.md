## Usage
<!--
  In this section you can add commands/features that are commonly used. It
  should _at least_ include the default usage. A bonus is if you add
  descriptions for extra features. If it's a command-line tool you are writing
  about you could for example write about some useful flags. See iTerm/tree
  for an example.
